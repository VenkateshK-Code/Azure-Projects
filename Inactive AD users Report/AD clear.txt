With a single PowerShell command, you can generate a clean report of all user accounts that haven't logged on in the last 90 days. No more guesswork.

🎯 \*\*Here's the game plan:\*\*
🔹 Use the `Search-ADAccount` cmdlet—it's fast and built for this exact task.
🔹 Target specific OUs to avoid accidentally flagging critical service accounts.
🔹 Always export to a CSV for review \*before\* taking any action like disabling accounts.

💻 \*\*PowerShell One-Liner:\*\*
```powershell
# Find inactive users \(no logon in 90 days\) and export to CSV
Search-ADAccount -AccountInactive -TimeSpan 90.00:00:00 -UsersOnly \| Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, LastLogonDate \| Export-Csv -Path C:\Temp\InactiveUsers.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

✅ \*\*The Payoff:\*\*
✅ Save hours of manual work each quarter.
✅ Harden your security posture by removing old access.
✅ Keep your Active Directory clean and audit-ready.
